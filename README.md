# ♫ h0b0-redo ♫

Welcome to the repository for the online audiovisual experience of *h0b0*'s 𝓻𝓮𝓭𝓸 album. This project is inspired by the underlying circularity of the album's concept. As 𝓻𝓮𝓭𝓸 implies, this circle is ever present — *a loop*.

Each song is a circle by itself, loopable, infinite. Join these pieces and compose the larger circle, the album.

### Have fun with the experience [here](https://redo.h0b0.me).
