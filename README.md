# h0b0-redo ♫
[h0b0](https://h0b0.me/) redo web album experience project.

This project is inspired by the circularity of the album's concept, redo. The loop is ever present — a circle.

## Development
### Create a circular element that represents the album:
- [x] polygon with n vertices (18 → album-size);
- [x] each vertex contains a circle (song);
- [x] clickable circles that jump to song;

### Music Controller
- [x] song loop mode;
- [x] album loop mode;
- [ ] user controls for album / song mode;

### Circles
- [x] on hover: animate color;
- [ ] on hover: animate circle size;

### Background visuals (shaders):
- [x] made template gradient background with GLSL;
- [ ] imported and played video on the background;
- [ ] applied effects to imported video;

### Responsiveness
- [ ] adapt to canvas/screen resize (e.g. device rotation);
- [ ] polygon/circles drawing on smaller screens (will it work?);
